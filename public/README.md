## Exploring MealsDB API

A react project that explores the use of The MealDB-API. This project also demonstrates the use of react-hook-form, react-helmet, react-router-dom, axios to fetch data from the API, as well as function components and hooks.

A click on each meal redirects the user to a details page.

For the purpose of this project, when the form is submitted, the data is not added to the API.
